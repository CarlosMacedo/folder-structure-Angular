A feature is a group of components.
If the component is EXCLUSIVE for the feature, it must be created inside feature folder â€“ following the order of the tree.

Example: the @shared components is used by up to all features. While the component-x (and y) is only for feature-a (and childs a1/a2). The component-w (and z) is only for feature-a1.
